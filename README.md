# WeatherPython
# Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.
# To accomplish this, I utilize a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API.

# My objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

# Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
# Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
# Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
# Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
